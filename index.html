    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Prit, currently pursuing Big Data Analytics. This website is part of my work for BDA594, where I’ll share insights from my labs. I’m passionate about data science, machine learning, and building cool things with code.</p>

        <h4>Question 3: Dataset Answer</h4>
        <ul> Link - <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult"></a></ul>
        <ul>When I look at the Adult dataset from UC Irvine, it reminds me a lot of the work I did during my last summer internship when I was dealing with third-party data. We were looking at features like bot ownership, mortgagor credit debt, and employer names. I had to segment the data to see if it was useful for our internal customer data, and, honestly, it was surprising to see how strong the relationships were between some of those factors. Similarly, this dataset feels like it has so much potential.        </ul>
        <ul>For instance, it’s designed to predict whether someone earns more than $50K annually based on variables like education, work class, and age. It’s a good dataset for income prediction models, especially if you’re interested in how factors like job type or marital status might influence earnings. I can see how features like these can be useful for building classifiers that help businesses or researchers understand income distributions.        </ul>
        <ul>Beyond machine learning, I think it could be great for policy analysis too. Imagine using this to figure out what types of workers are struggling most, so governments or non-profits can design more targeted programs. Kinda like how I was figuring out whether those third-party data points could help our internal teams, this dataset can help uncover trends in economic inequality.        </ul>
        <ul>What’s cool is that the data is fairly clean and easy to work with, so you can dive into things like decision trees or logistic regression models to start exploring patterns without too much hassle. </ul>

        <h4>Question 4: Book Answer</h4>
        <ul> Link - <a href=" https://ggplot2-book.org/"></a></ul>
        <ul>One of the free data science books that really got my attention is "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham, who is a key figure in the R community, authored this book and is known for his contributions to data science, particularly for creating ggplot2 itself, as well as many other R packages that make data wrangling a lot easier. Wickham is affiliated with RStudio, which is another reason why this book is so comprehensive.        </ul>
        <ul>This book came in super handy during my first semester when I was taking the MIS649 course. I had to use R and ggplot2 for the first time, and I was completely new to both. I realized ggplot2 is quite better than Matplotlib from Python, like. It just feels more intuitive once you get the hang of it, and the graphics you can create are way more elegant with less code. The book really breaks it down in a way that makes the learning process smooth, I just had to skim the book for an hour to develop a base knowledge to start working with.        </ul>
        <ul>For anyone looking to step up their data visualization game, especially in R, this book is a great resource.        </ul>
